<title>Custom Programming Interface for WxPic</title>
</head>

<body>
<h1><a name="custom_interfaces" id="custom_interfaces">Adapting WxPic for other
  (simple) programming interfaces</a></h1>
<p>
If your (simple) programmer for the parallel or serial&nbsp;port is not listed
on the 'interface' tab, here's what to do:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Copy and rename one of the SampleInterfaceXXX.INI in the 'interfaces'
    subdirectory (part of the installation package) into another file, for example
    MyInterface.INI
  </li><li>
    With your favorite text editor, load 'your'
    <a name="interface_definition_file" id="interface_definition_file">interface
    definition file</a> and modify it for your needs. There is a section
</li></ul>
<p>
[ProgrammerControlLines]
</p><p>
with the following entries ... some of them optional, only a few are mandatory,
marked with "m"=mandatory:
</p><dl>

  <dt>
    <u>DataIn (m)</u>
  </dt><dd>
    serial data line from PIC to PC. Example for a simple interface on the serial
    port:<br>
    <code>DataIn=cts</code><br>
  </dd><dt>
    <u>OkButton</u>

  </dt><dd>
    signal from programming adapter to PC for an optional "OK"-button.
  </dd><dt>
    <u>VppOnOff (m)</u>
  </dt><dd>
    control line to turn the programming voltage on(H) and off(L). From PC to
    PIC. Example for a simple interface:<br>
    <code>VppOnOff=txd</code><br>
  </dd><dt>

    <u>VddOnOff</u>
  </dt><dd>
    control line to turn the supply voltage on(H) and off(L). From PC to PIC.
  </dd><dt>
    <u>PullMclrDown</u>
  </dt><dd>
    control line to pull the MCLR pin down to ground. As far as I know, only
    Microchip's "AN589"-programmer uses this (with PullMclrDown=D4)
  </dd><dt>
    <u>Connect</u>

  </dt><dd>
    control line to connect(H) or disconnect(L) the target. From PC to programming
    interface. Usually "!D7".
  </dd><dt>
    <u>ClockOut (m)</u>
  </dt><dd>
    serial clock output from PC to PIC. Example for a simple interface on the
    serial port:<br>
    <code>ClockOut=rts</code><br>
  </dd><dt>

    <u>DataOut (m)</u>
  </dt><dd>
    Definies the <em>interface signal</em> which is used to send serial data
    output from PC to PIC. Example for a simple interface on the serial port:<br>
    <code>DataOut=dtr</code><br>
  </dd><dt style="text-decoration: underline;">
    DataOutWhileReading
  </dt><dd>

    Defines the <em>logic state</em> (not a control signal) of the data output
    line while reading. For most interfaces, the data output must be set to a
    logic "1" by the programmer, so the PIC can pull the serial output low (because
    most interfaces use an NPN-transistor or open collector output stage, and
    a pullup resistor connected to Vdd). For interfaces with a tristate output,
    the level of the serial ouput line while reading doesn't matter (use "OutEnable"
    to define the control line for the tristate driver in that case). Example
    for a simple interface on the serial port:<br>
    <code>DataOutWhileReading=1</code><br>
  </dd><dt>
    <u>ClkEnable</u>
  </dt><dd>
    Tristate buffer control for the serial clock output. As far as I know, the
    only interface which uses this is the original Microchip "AN589" programmer.
    "H" level means output enabled (from PC to PIC), "L" means output disabled
    (high impedance). Example for a simple interface:<br>

    <code>ClkEnable=nc</code><br>
  </dd><dt>
    <u>OutEnable</u>
  </dt><dd>
    Tristate buffer control for the data output. As far as I know, the only interface
    which uses this is the original Microchip "AN589" programmer. "H" level means
    output enabled (from PC to PIC), "L" means output disabled (high
    impedance).<br>
  </dd><dt>
    <u>RedLed</u>

  </dt><dd>
    Optional output from the PC to a red LED on the programmer, signalling "error
    state" after programming.
  </dd><dt>
    <u>GreenLed</u>
  </dt><dd>
    Optional output from the PC to a green LED on the programmer, signalling
    "success" after programming.
</dd></dl>
<p>
The <i>function token</i> in the definition file&nbsp;is followed by a "="
character, and a symbolic definition for the <i>control signal</i> which
is used. This can be any of the centronics data lines, inverted (LOW-active)
or not inverted (HIGH-active). "Active" must be seen from the target's point
of view. If -for example- there is an inverter between the serial data output
on centronics D0 and the PIC's "RB7" pin, the definition line must be

</p><p>
DataOut=!D0
</p><dl>
  <dt>
    which means
  </dt><dd>
    "The serial data output is connected to D0, inverted" &nbsp;(the '!' character
    to invert something is "C"-style)
</dd></dl>
<p>
These names can be used for control lines on the centronics port ("LPT1"
or "LPT2"). Non-inverted always means active-HIGH level on the PC's output,
no matter what the centronics printer specification says (signals which are
inverted by the PC hardware are automatically inverted by software&nbsp;!).
</p><dl>
  <dt>

    <u>D0, D1, ... D7&nbsp;</u>
  </dt><dd>
    centronics data, not inverted. Can be used as OUTPUTS from PC to target.
  </dd><dt>
    <u>!D0, !D1, ... !D7</u>
  </dt><dd>
    centronics data, inverted. Can be used as OUTPUTS from PC to target.
  </dd><dt>
    <u>pap, &nbsp;!pap</u>

  </dt><dd>
    centronics "paper out", normal (H=active) or inverted (L=active). Can be
    used as INPUT from target to PC.
  </dd><dt>
    <u>ack, &nbsp;!ack</u>
  </dt><dd>
    centronics "acknowledge", normal (H=active) or inverted (L=active). Can be
    used as INPUT from target to PC.
  </dd><dt>
    <u>str, alf, psl, ini</u>

  </dt><dd>
    Other control signals OUTPUTS from PC to target: strobe, automatic line feed,
    select printer, initialize printer(reset).
  </dd><dt>
    <u>bsy, sld, err</u>
  </dt><dd>
    Other INPUTS from target to PC: busy, selected, error
  </dd><dt>
    <u>nc</u>
  </dt><dd>

    not connected. Use this token for all unused/unsupported functions, like
    "RedLed=nc" . &nbsp;All unused functions appear disabled on the "Interface
    Test" tab.
</dd></dl>
<p>
For an interface on the serial port, these control lines are available (may
be used if you have an interface with an inverting RS-232 level converter
like the MAX232). If you use the original "COM84" programmer, you don't have
to write your own interface definition !
</p><dl>
  <dt>
    <u>txd, !txd</u>
  </dt><dd>
    Transmit Data (here: abused as simple control line). For COM84, "txd" is
    used as programming voltage (non-inverted)
  </dd><dt>

    <u>dtr, !dtr</u>
  </dt><dd>
    Data Terminal Ready. For COM84, "dtr" is used as serial data output from
    PC to PIC (non-inverted)
  </dd><dt>
    <u>rts, !rts</u>
  </dt><dd>
    Ready To Send. For COM84, "rts" is the serial clock output from PC to PIC.
  </dd><dt>
    <u>cts, !cts</u>

  </dt><dd>
    Clear To Send. For COM84, "cts" is the serial data input (from PIC to PC).
</dd></dl>
<p>
Other "control signal tokens" are listed in the <a href="LptPort.htm#lpt_connector">LPT
connector table</a>, or in the &nbsp;SampleInterfaceXXX.INI files. Every
macro definition can control up to 4 output lines, like:<br>
SelVddHigh=D0+D1+!D2+!D3<br>
which will set both D0+D1 high and D2+D3 low when the supply voltage shall
generator shall be configured for "high supply voltage (see notes on simple
production-grade programmers).</p>
<p>

If you have the source code of WxPic, look for "PicHw_TokenToInOutFunc()"
to find out which tokens are implemented so far ;-)
</p>
<p>
To continue the installation of a customized programming interface...
</p><ul>
  <li>
    Save your modified interface definition file (interfaces\MyInterface.INI)
    now, and close the text editor.
  </li>
  <li>
    Open WxPic's "Interface" tab and select "Custom , on XXX port, defined by
    file" (XXX = COM or LPT; scroll to the end of the list !).<br>
    Notice that the edit field under "Custom interface definition file" will
    be enabled now.
  </li><li>
    Enter the name of your interface definition file in the edit field, or click
    "Select" to open a file selector.<br>

    Note: THE INTERFACE DEFINITION FILE MUST BE IN THE 'interfaces' SUBDIRECTORY
    !
  </li><li>
    If an error message like "invalid signal definition" appears, check your
    interface definition file again (with a text editor) and try again.
</li></ul>
<p>
If everything is ok, check the proper function of the control lines with
the interface test option. Keep your interface
definition file in WxPic's directory, because this file will be loaded whenever
you start the program again (the <b><i>definitions</i></b> are NOT copied
into the SETTINGS.INI file. Only the <i><b>name</b></i> of your interface
definition file is saved in the settings !)</p>
